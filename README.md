# Mortgage Industry Business Analysis

## Mortgage Delinquency Rates
Mortgage delinquency rates help assess borrower stress and overall loan portfolio health. Early-stage delinquencies (30–89 days past due) may indicate emerging financial strain, while 90+ day delinquencies often signal elevated risk. Linking these trends to unemployment data adds actionable economic context.

## Unemployment Insurance Exhaustion Rate
The unemployment insurance (UI) exhaustion rate is the percentage of individuals who have used up all of their allotted state-funded, regular unemployment benefits before finding a new job. A rising rate indicates worsening economic conditions, as more people are struggling to find employment within the standard, typically 26-week, timeframe. 

### What is a "Bad" Exhaustion Rate?
Severe (40%+): Historically, when 40% or more of recipients exhaust their benefits, it signifies a major economic failure to create jobs, comparable to or worse than major recessionary periods (e.g., 2003, early 1980s).

High (30% - 39%): Signals that the labor market is difficult and long-term unemployment is rising, making it harder for workers to find new jobs before their benefits run out.

Stable/Normal (20% - 29%): In a stable, growing economy, it is normal for a portion of the population to take longer to find suitable work, though this number should not spike rapidly. 

It is important to note that a "good" (low) unemployment rate does not always mean a low exhaustion rate. Even if the overall unemployment rate is relatively low (e.g., around 4-5%), a high exhaustion rate indicates that those who are unemployed are struggling intensely to find new employment.
